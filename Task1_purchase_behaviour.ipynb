The prediction should cover a period of six weeks ahead of time, incorporating various factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. The end product should provide reliable forecasts to assist the finance team in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation, inventory management, and strategic planning."

    "##### Rossmann Pharmaceuticals requires accurate sales forecasting to optimize its operations and maximize profitability. Currently, individual store managers rely on subjective methods for sales prediction, which may lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. By implementing a data-driven approach, the company aims to improve the accuracy of sales forecasts, enabling better resource allocation, inventory planning, and promotional strategies. Additionally, the centralized prediction system will provide a standardized method for forecasting across all stores, ensuring consistency and alignment with company objectives. Ultimately, the project addresses the business need for enhanced decision-making capabilities and improved operational efficiency within Rossmann Pharmaceuticals"
